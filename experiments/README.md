# Experiments Directory

This directory is for experimental code, prototypes, and proof-of-concepts.

## Purpose
- Test new features before integrating them into the main codebase
- Prototype different approaches to solving problems
- Experiment with new libraries or techniques
- Quick proof-of-concept implementations

## Guidelines
- Each experiment should be in its own subdirectory
- Include a README.md in each experiment explaining its purpose
- Keep experiments isolated from the main codebase
- Document any interesting findings or conclusions
